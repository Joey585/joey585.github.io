  <p class="results">Chair has <strong>2,066 </strong>total messages after 2/13/22</p>
  <p class="results">Chair has <strong>140</strong> total warns after 2/06/22</p>
  <br>
  <p class="results">Summary: I cannot believe the amount of warns chair has gotten. He is a very active staff who checks nsfw when we are all in public (lmao). He has requested
    that I removed 18 warns from his total :) Continue being active chair because you make a good impact, same with Fredboys.
