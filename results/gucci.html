<p class="results">Gucci has <strong>339 </strong>total messages after 2/06/22</p>
<p class="results">Gucci has <strong>19</strong> total warns after 2/06/22</p>
<br>
<p class="results">
  Summary: Gucci has failed to meet both of moderation quotas, the warns only being by 1. It's up to the staff to decide his fate. Overall gucci is still a good staff, he just needs to be a little more active...
