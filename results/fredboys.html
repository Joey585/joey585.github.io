  <p class="results">Fredboys has <strong>2,566</strong> total messages after 2/13/22</p>
  <p class="results">Fredboys has <strong>182</strong> total warns after 2/13/22</p>

  <p class="results">Summary: It will be weird making this summary since I know Fredboys very irl. To stay professional I will not be biased whatsoever and count warns carefully.
  After Fredboys was hired, I mentored him a little even if it was hella annoying. But he picked it up quick and every day he would be warning people. Manging to top chair with warns!
    I did take off 1 warn though because he reacted to the warn saying "oops". LOL
